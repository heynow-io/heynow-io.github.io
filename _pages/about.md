## Ocado Technology
On the surface, [Ocado.com](http://www.ocado.com/) is the world’s largest online-only grocery retailer. Customers use our award winning mobile applications and website to place their orders, which are packed in our world–class automated warehouses, and delivered in one hour time slots.

Look under the surface however, and you’ll unearth a dynamic technology company that has the look, feel and culture of an innovative software start-up - Ocado Technology. That’s because we develop all the software that powers Ocado in-house.
